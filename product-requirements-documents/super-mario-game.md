## **2. Game Experience and Features**

### **2.1 Gameplay Overview**

- The player navigates a pixelated hero across horizontally scrolling levels.
- Gameplay includes jumping over gaps, avoiding or defeating enemies, collecting coins, and discovering power-ups.
- Levels are themed (e.g., grassy plains, underground, castle) and progressively increase in difficulty.

### **2.2 Player Mechanics**

- **Movement**: Walk left/right using keyboard input.
- **Jumping**: Tap to hop over obstacles and onto platforms.
- **Enemy Interaction**: Jumping on enemies defeats them; collision otherwise causes death.
- **Power-ups**: Transform the character (e.g., grow larger, shoot fireballs).
- **Damage Recovery**: Power-ups offer one-hit protection.

### **2.3 Visual and Audio Presentation**

- Retro pixel art, colourful tiles, and animated backgrounds.
- Background parallax scrolling adds depth.
- Engaging sound design including:
    - Coin chime
    - Jump and power-up effects
    - Victory and Game Over themes

### **2.4 Levels and Objectives**

- **Level 1**: Gentle introduction to movement, jumping, and collecting coins.
- **Level 2**: Introduces enemies and moving platforms.
- **Completion**: Each level ends with a celebratory animation (e.g., reaching a flagpole).

### **2.5 User Interface**

- Top screen HUD showing:
    - **Coins** collected
    - **Score**
    - **Remaining Lives**
    - **Time Limit** (optional)
